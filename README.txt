This is a commandline app used to time workouts.

How it works:
1. Set the total amount of minutes you want to workout for
2. Set how long you want to rest in between sets
3. Set how long each interval or set is

In the context of this app, a set or interval period is how long you will perform a particular exercise.
There is no concept of reps here, only duration. 

This app is dependant on installing the following:
pip install playsound

Future Plans:
Add user interface
Add specific workout programs
